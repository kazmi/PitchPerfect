# Pitch Perfect

The Pitch Perfect app allows users to record a sound using the deviceâ€™s microphone. It then allows users to play the recorded sound back with different sound modulations.
The app has two view controller scenes:
* Record Sounds View: Allows users to record a sound.  
* Play Sounds View: Allows users to play the recorded sound back with effects.
